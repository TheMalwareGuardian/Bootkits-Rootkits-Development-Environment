# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Bootkits & Rootkits Development Environment

This repository is part of my effort to make Bootkit & Rootkit development more accessible. Setting up a proper environment for low-level development can be tedious and time-consuming, so the scripts provided here automate the setup process, making it easier to configure and start experimenting with bootkits and rootkits.

## üñ•Ô∏è Setting Up the Environment for Developing Bootkits and Rootkits on Windows

This [PowerShell script](https://github.com/TheMalwareGuardian/Bootkits-Rootkits-Development-Environment/blob/main/Scripts/Setup_Development_Environment_Windows.ps1) is meticulously crafted to automate the setup of a development environment specifically tailored for creating [UEFI](https://wiki.osdev.org/UEFI) Bootkits and [Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/) Rootkits on Windows. It streamlines the otherwise manual and time-consuming tasks of installing necessary tools and configuring [TianoCore](https://www.tianocore.org/) [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) (EFI Development Kit) and [WDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) (Windows Driver Kit), allowing developers to focus more on bootkits/rootkits innovation and less on setup üòâ.

### How to Execute

To automate the creation and setup of your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Open PowerShell (Some options require administrator permissions):
	- Open PowerShell by searching for it in the Start Menu.
	- For administrator permissions, right-click PowerShell and select Run as Administrator.

2. Set the Execution Policy (Optional):
	- If you encounter an error related to script execution, you can temporarily change the execution policy by running: 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass'. This allows scripts to run in the current session without permanently changing system settings. Alternatively, to remove all restrictions, use: 'Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted'.

3. Navigate to the Script Directory:
	- Use the cd command to navigate to the folder containing the script.

4. Execute the Script:
	- Run the script by entering '.\Setup_Development_Environment_Windows.ps1'

5. Follow the Prompts:
	- Respond to the on-screen prompts to select your desired action.
